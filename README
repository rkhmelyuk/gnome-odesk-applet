oDesk GNOME applet, shows number of closed hours today and this week, also shows familiar odesk chart.

It has hardcoded my paths in files:
 * GNOME_odesk_Factory.server
 * settings.py

Setup:
 1. create odesk.properties file and fill information
 2. edit GNOME_odesk_Factory.server to write correct full path to the applet.py file.
 3. copy GNOME_odesk_Factory.server to /usr/lib/bonobo/servers
 4. add chart

May need to install python-gnomeapplet, if fails to run:
 $ sudo apt-get install python-gnomeapplet

BTW: code is awful as this is my first app on python (blush)
